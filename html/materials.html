    <h3>Fabric</h3>
    <p>

    <strong>Selecting your fabric.</strong>
    Aida cloth is the most commonly used fabric for Cross Stitch. The material appears? As a grid like pattern and provides a guide on where to stitch. It comes in different sizes depending on the density of the cloth per square inch.
    Tip: The lower the stitch count the easier it is or the simpler the pattern is.

    Other Options
    You can use any other fabrics to cross stitch but these will not have guides to line up your stitches and are overall more difficult to use. Try to stick to thinner fabrics if this is your choice. Anything is possible so donâ€™t restrict yourself.

    <h3>Thread</h3>

    Choosing your thread.
    Embroidery floss will be your thread of choice in most of your projects. It comes in many colours and has 6 threads, only 1-3 will typically be used at one time. You can also buy waxed thread if you are having difficulty working with your thread. Waxing keeps the thread from separating.

    Tip: If you are worried about wasting your thread you can start with wool or yarn to practice. Keep in mind it can be difficult as it will not be as smooth as thread and can split more easily. It is however a cheaper option.
