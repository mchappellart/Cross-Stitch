          <h4> Preparation </h4>
          <p>First off we need to prep the hoop. Separate the hoop pieces by loosening the screw at the top, then center your fabric over the smaller hoop. Place the larger hoop on top and sandwich the fabric between them tightening the screw as you go. Tug at the fabric and adjust the tightness to get a firm and flat surface.</p>
          <h4>Securing your thread</h4>
          <p>I know you want to start stitching but first we need to secure our thread. Thread your needle with your floss of choice. Poke the needle upward from below the hoop, and hold thel end of the thread in place while pulling the needle through. Still holding onto the tail, poke down then up again and pause, when a loop is created. Feed the tail of the thread through this loop, then finish tugging the needle to pin the tail beneath the stitch. This is to make sure that your stitches don’t come undone, repeat a few more times until you feel it is secure.</p>

            Thread upward through the bottom left corner, and down through the upper right (diagonal). Continue up through the bottom right corner, then go down through the upper left (diagonal).
            You can also create a full stitch using half stitches then going backwards along the same line. To see how to half stitch click [here].

          <h4>Mistakes</h4>
          <p>Don’t worry if you make a mistake. Just un-thread your needle or use a spare, use your needle to loosen the stitch and pull it back through. You can also use an unpicker or scissors to cut the stitches that are incorrect and pull with your fingers.</p>
          <h4 class="mt-5">Finishing the Thread</h4>
          <p>When you are running low on thread or need to change colour,finish your stitches by slipping the needle under a row of stitches on the back of your fabric. Do not pull through the front and snip off the excess thread.</p>
